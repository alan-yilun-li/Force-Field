# HarambeQuest

HarambeQuest is a silly game I made (and am currently working on) to practice working with Java, 
the JavaFX framework, and game loops.

As you can see, the goal of the game is to rack up points by catching as many bananas as possible (before they rot on the ground!) and avoid catching the babies (... well, before anything unfortunate happens). 

I also tried using a variable time step game loop. This idea was given to me when reading Robert Nystrom's "Game Programming Patterns" (found here: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html). 

The sprites (gorilla, banana, baby) were found on public online libraries and then personally modified for the purposes of the game. The other art assets currently in use were made on Adobe Illustrator by myself.
